# Design patterns

## Behavioral

### Iterator

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

### Strategy

It is used to separate strategies and to enable fast switching between them.

### Observer

It is used to notify the rest of the system about certain events in certain place.

## Creational

### Factory

It is used when you need to build (not create) an object and use it many times as necessary.

### Prototype

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

## Structural

### Adapter

It is used to translate one interface for a class into a compatible interface. For example create a adapter as interface with generic functions to get data (find and findAll), then create a class with these functions and get the data as each one works.

### Composite

To treat a group of objects the same way as a single instance of the object.

### Decorator

It is used when you want to adjust the behavior of an object at run-time, and with that, reduce redundant inheritances and the number of classes.

### Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.
