# Design patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. 

## History

There is not a exact history, when a solution gets repeated in various projects, someone eventually puts a name to it and describes the solution in detail.

## Classification of patterns.

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called __idioms__. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are __architectural patterns__.

## Behavioral

Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Command

It converts requests or simple operations into objects.

### Iterator

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

### Observer

It is used to notify the rest of the system about certain events in certain place.

### Strategy

It is used to separate strategies and to enable fast switching between them.

## Creational

Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Abstract Factory

It solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

### Builder

It allows constructing complex objects step by step.

### Factory

It is used when you need to build (not create) an object and use it many times as necessary.

### Prototype

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### Singleton

It ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.

## Structural

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

### Adapter

It is used to translate one interface for a class into a compatible interface. For example create a adapter as interface with generic functions to get data (find and findAll), then create a class with these functions and get the data as each one works.

### Composite

To treat a group of objects the same way as a single instance of the object.

### Decorator

It is used when you want to adjust the behavior of an object at run-time, and with that, reduce redundant inheritances and the number of classes.

### Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.
