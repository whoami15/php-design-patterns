# Advanced PHP Topics

_Challenge based on the [#100daysofcode](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) to learn more about PHP and advanced programming._

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least one hours every day until I close the challenge.*

#### Start Date
April 19th, 2021.

## Additional Rules
1. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
2. I will push code to GitHub every weekday so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and commit program here so that others can see my progress.
4. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
