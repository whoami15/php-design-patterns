# SOLID.

It is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more **understandable, flexible, and maintainable**. It is often used with systems that use an **object-oriented design**.

These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in his 2000 paper **Design Principles and Design Patterns**.

– **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).** “A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.”

– **Open/Closed Principle (OCP).** “You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.”

– **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).** “Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.”

– **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).** “Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.”

– **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).** “Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.”

It allows to maintain a **high cohesion** and, therefore, a **low software coupling**.

## Cohesion

It refers to the degree where different elements stay together to achieve a better result than if they worked separately.

## Coupling

It refers to the degree of interdependence that two software units have with each other.

## Criticism of SOLID.

Many developers accuse SOLID of being **ambiguous, confusing, of complicating the code, of delaying the development process, and even brand them as totally wrong and unnecessary**.
