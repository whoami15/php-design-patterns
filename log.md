# Advanced PHP topics - Log

### Day 0: April 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Organize the challenge and define the rules.

**Thoughts:** SOLID, design patterns, problems about programming logic, data structure and more. This challenges is going to be focused in improving my skills as programmer with PHP. Making a real and reachable challenge.

### Day 1: April 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice about the first two principles of SOLID.

**Thoughts:** Single responsibility and open/closed principles to make specific classes with a defined responsibility, with high cohesion extensible and not modifiable. With basic explanation, bad and right example.

**Folder:** [solid](solid)

### Day 2: April 21th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice about the last three principles of SOLID.

**Thoughts:** Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation and Dependency inversion principles. With basic explanation, bad and right example.

**Folder:** [solid](solid)

### Day 3: April 22th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: A summary about SOLID and some sources.

**Thoughts:** Main information about these principles, main concepts and some good sources from internet to read more about it, even there are criticisms and criticisms to that criticisms and links to books.

**File:** [solid summary](solid/0-solid-summary.md)

### Day 4: April 23th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 3 common design patterns; command, factory and singleton.

**Thoughts:** Not so hard patterns, even I have use factory in Laravel when I create some test data, all the data is defined in the class, not when the class is instantiated.

**File:** [design patterns](design-patterns/creational)

### Day 5: April 26th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 2 common design patterns in php; adapter and strategy.

**Thoughts:** Design patterns that apply some SOLID principles. Both allow scalability without alter the main behavior. I found some interesting sources in internet (even a github repository with many design patterns in php, even with test) and I create a brief summary.

**File:** [design patterns](design-patterns/design-patterns.md)

### Day 6: April 27th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 3 design patterns; observer, composite and decorator.

**Thoughts:** So important the knowledge about SOLID, here I looked more design patterns that apply these principles. So useful design patterns to extend functionalities and comply the open/close principle.

**File:** [design patterns](design-patterns/design-patterns.md)

### Day 7: April 28th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 3 design patterns; iterator, prototype and facade.

**Thoughts:** Some common design patterns, I have watched facade in Laravel, Collections (from Iterator) in Symfony but Prototype I haveÂ´nt, I think it could be used in a special problem. Many tools available to solve a possible future problem with good practices.

**File:** [design patterns](design-patterns/design-patterns.md)

### Day 8: April 29th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 2 design patterns; abstract factory and builder.

**Thoughts:** Two common creational design patterns, I found abstract factory some difficult. Builder was easier, I have worked with it as **SQL query builder**, a easier way to manage data without write SQL code, each method add SQL code to the query and at the final the entire SQL query is executed.

**File:** [design patterns](design-patterns/design-patterns.md)

### Day 9: April 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Review design patterns and more notes.

**Thoughts:** I added more information to the first design patterns I looked and more information in general about design pattern. After I finished all the most common design patterns and take a look about data structure I will practice with some problems and solve then with this powerful tools.

### Day 10: May 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Design patterns; Chain of Responsibility, State and Template Method.

**Thoughts:** Some behavioral design patterns. I had the Idea about Chain of Responsibility because I have used Middleware in Laravel. About State I have not used it. And finally Template Method I have not used it with PHP but I have the idea due to Hooks in Vue.js.

**File:** [design patterns](design-patterns/)

### Day 11: May 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Design patterns; Bridge and Proxy.

**Thoughts:** Two structural design patterns. These are not common in PHP, and these are the last I learn. I looked many similarities among these patterns and Decorator pattern, besides I have not worked with them I got confused and I search and I found more information.
